# ReinLife_Backend
 Backend for ReinLife app (mHealth platform).

 ReinLife is a cross-platform open source mobile Health app and research platform. [This](https://tbd) is a manuscript introducing the plotform.
 We are using Google firebase service.
 
 The frontend is written in flutter and can be found at [reinlife_flutter](https://github.com/ReinLife-AC297r/reinlife_flutter).

# Current Workflow
1. Recreate python/anaconda environment using environment.yml
2. Researchers can look at `example_researcher_defined_code.ipynb` which is a jupyter notebook that contains the example code of of the API should be used. The APIs are in the module `ReinLifeResearcher.py`


## Environment Configuration
<!--
### Create Envionement
 conda activate relearnlife
 conda install flask requests
### Save Env
 conda env export > environment.yml)
-->
### Recreate Env
I am using anaconda to create the environment. Here are the steps to repeat the envionment.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate reinlife
```
## files
`ReinLifeResearcher.py` is the module that contains APIs for researchers to use

`server2firestore.py` is a module that contains helper functions to communcate with the firestore. We do not currently have an extra server layer in our current implementation although it is named as "server"2firstore.

`example_researcher_defined_code.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook that contains the example code of of the API should be used.
